SELECT
    job_postings_fact.job_id,
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short,
    job_postings_fact.job_title,
    company_dim.name AS company_name,
    ROUND(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg, 0) AS salary_year_avg,
    job_postings_fact.job_work_from_home

FROM job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim
    ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND
    job_postings_fact.job_work_from_home = 'Yes'
    AND

**üí° Key insights:**
The results of this query reveal a critical distinction between foundational skills and specialized ones. While our previous analysis of top‚Äëpaying jobs highlighted the importance of a wide range of advanced tools, this broader view across all data‚Äëfocused job postings underscores a clear message:

- The highest demand is for fundamental, versatile skills. Python and SQL are overwhelmingly the two most sought-after skills, with demand counts that are more than double that of any other skill.
- Cloud computing skills (AWS and Azure) and visualization tools (Tableau and Power BI) show high demand.

This data suggests that mastering the basics is the most reliable path to entry and growth in the data job market.


### 04_top_avg_salary_perSkill.sql üíµ
```sql
/*
Purpose: What are the top skills based on salary?
- Look at the average salary associated with each skill for data related positions
- Focuses on roles with specified salaries, regardless of location

Why?
It reveals how different skills impact salary levels for data related roles and helps identify the most financially rewarding skills to acquire or improve
*/

SELECT
    skills.skills,
    ROUND(AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary

    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND

    skills.skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
![Average Salary per Skill](./assets/avg_salary_per_skill.png)

**üí° Key insights:**
- Specialization commands a premium: Highest-paying skills are often niche and specialized (deep learning frameworks, niche databases, and platform-specific tools).
- AI/ML expertise (PyTorch, Hugging Face, Theano) correlates with higher salaries.
- Specialized databases (Mongo, Cassandra, Neo4j) and full‚Äëstack/backend skills (Node, Scala, ASP.NET Core) also appear high on the salary list.

This means: combine strong fundamentals with a specialized skill to maximize salary potential.

![Most Optimal Skills](./assets/optimal_skills.png)
**üí° Key insights:**
- Big Data is a high-value field: Spark, Kafka, and Hadoop show strong job counts and salaries.
- Cloud-native infra matters: Snowflake, Redshift, and Kubernetes are important skills for modern data platforms.
- ML tooling and frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn) remain high-value skills.
- Non-relational DB expertise (Mongo, Cassandra, Neo4j) is valuable for specific data models.
- Integration skills (Airflow, Kafka) are crucial for end-to-end pipeline work.
